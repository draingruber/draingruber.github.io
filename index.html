	<p>My name is Deborah.  I have been working toward my AS in <i>Computer Science and Programming Applications</i> for 2 years.  I have been a teacher of Technology & Computer Science to grades k-12 for the past 28 years, as well as various other subjects.  I am currently the Director of Technology for a private ps-12th grade school of approximately 800 students and I teach AP Computer Science A & AP Computer Science Principles.  I live in the central valley with my husband and 2 of my 4 children.  The other 2 are enrolled in college and the Army ROTC programs at their schools.  I enjoy reading and walking and spending time with my husband and children at the beach.</p>

	<p style="clear: both;">I am attending this class because I enjoy programming and want to learn more langauges.  As well, I teach high school computer science and I want to be able to include mobile web app development in my curriculum.</p>
